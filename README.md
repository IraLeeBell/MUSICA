Musical Uplifting Sounds for Interplanetary Companion Artifacts

This is a lightweight library for audio that space based rovers, robots, etc. can play as desired. The library has been created in the traditional beep code style, ensuring that the robotic objects can emulate the human audio experience in space without the burden of requiring excessive amounts of data storage or power consumption.
